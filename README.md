WRF V4.0.1 model runs using the Thompson-Eidhammer microphysics scheme for the Microphysics of Antarctic Clouds campaign. Simulations to test the influence of CCN number concentrations on cloud microphysics, using the case study observations from 27 November 2015 for comparison.

Issues with v3.9.1.1 -- error with mismatch between p_top in namelist and in input file. Not obvious why this error occurred.
